<!-- XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language similar to HTML, but without predefined tags to use.
 Instead, you define your own tags designed specifically for your needs. 
This is a powerful way to store data in a format that can be stored, searched, and shared

<?xml version ="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<root>
<tree>Ahmed</tree>
<tree>Ali</tree>
<tree>Mohamed</tree>
</root>


</xml> -->


<!-- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. 
It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. 
It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition 
- December 1999. -->
